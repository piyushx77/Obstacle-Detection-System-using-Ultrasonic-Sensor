# Obstacle-Detection-System-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor
This project creates a proximity alert system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer, and an LED. It detects objects based on distance and provides audio-visual alerts. This system can be used in applications like parking sensors, robot navigation, and blind spot detection.
