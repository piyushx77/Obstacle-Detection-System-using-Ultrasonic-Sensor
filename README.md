# Obstacle-Detection-System-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor
# ðŸš€ Ultrasonic Distance-Based Alert System  

This project utilizes an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** with an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to measure distances and trigger visual (LED) and audio (buzzer) alerts. The system is ideal for proximity detection in robotics, smart parking systems, and similar applications.

##  Hardware Components
- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: HC-SR04
- **LED**: Standard 5mm LED
- **Buzzer**: Active buzzer
- **Wires, breadboard**, and resistors as needed.

##  Overview
- Measures distance using ultrasonic pulses.
- Provides multi-level alerts based on distance:
  - **â‰¤10 cm**: Solid LED + continuous buzzer.
  - **11â€“25 cm**: Fast blinking + fast beep.
  - **26â€“50 cm**: Moderate blinking + moderate beep.
  - **51â€“100 cm**: Slow blinking + slow beep.
  - **101â€“150 cm**: Very slow blinking + beep.
  - **>150 cm**: LED off, no beep.
- Real-time distance data via Serial Monitor.

##  Working Principle
1. Sends ultrasonic pulses and measures echo time.
2. Calculates distance from the pulse duration.
3. Triggers LED and buzzer with patterns based on distance thresholds.

##  Usage Instructions
1. **Wiring**:  
   - Connect HC-SR04 `Trig` â†’ D6, `Echo` â†’ D5.
   - Connect LED anode â†’ D2 (with resistor), cathode â†’ GND.
   - Connect buzzer â†’ D8 and GND.

2. **Upload Code**:  
   - Open the code in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
   - Select the correct board (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0).
   - Upload the code.

3. **Monitor Output**:  
   - Open Serial Monitor at `9600` baud to view real-time distance.
